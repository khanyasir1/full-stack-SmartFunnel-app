# full-stack-SmartFunnel-app
This is a basic e-commerce funnel checkout app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. It lets users submit personal and payment info through a form, processes the order via AJAX and PHP, and redirects them to an upsell offer.  Itâ€™s a practical project for learning full-stack development and understanding sales funnel workflows.
